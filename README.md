# My_Bioinformatics_pathway.github.io
I have a background as a wet biologist, but at a certain point, I found myself drawn to statistics tasks, and it turned out to be an interesting and exciting experience for me. I decided to delve deeper into the world of data analysis and bioinformatics. I am aware that many of my wet lab colleagues may also face challenges in learning math and statistics. Therefore, I'd like to share my journey and the resources I have used or currently use as a bioinformatician.

## Information resources that I used 

### Practical courses
- EMBO Workshop. Integrating genomics and biophysics to comprehend functional genetic variation ([https://meetings.embo.org/event/17-variation])
  This event proved to be highly theoretical, offering excellent networking opportunities but lacking hands-on sessions.
  
- Course at EMBL-EBI. Cancer genomics ([https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/cancer-genomics-2022/])
  This course stands out for its comprehensive content and numerous hands-on sessions conducted by leading scientists in the field. I still find value in reviewing the presentations and scripts 
  provided during the course.
  
- MGNGS School of Data Analysis in Medical Genetics (on Russian) ([https://ngs.med-gen.ru/])
  During this course, we utilized Galaxy and faced a final exam where, within a limited time, we received a raw fastq file and a case description. The challenge was to generate a report 
  identifying a nucleotide variant and its class of pathogenicity.
  
- Bioinformatics Institute. Biostatistics and analysis of medical data(on Russian)([https://bioinf.me/education/stat]). NGS intensive(on Russian) ([https://bioinf.me/education/workshops/ngs])
  I have participated in both courses. The biostatistics part was well-balanced and coherent. However, the NGS intensive course felt somewhat cluttered, as if the authors aimed to include as 
  much information as possible, resulting in an overloaded experience.
  
- Machine Learning summer school. Bumblekite ([https://bioinf.me/education/stat](https://www.bumblekite.co/summer-school-23]). 
  This course is ideal for beginners in machine learning, offering practical courses in various fields of ML applications. While lacking a deep dive into theory, what sets this course apart is 
  the organizers' initiative to invite numerous top specialists in the field. These experts shared their life stories, providing inspiration and helping me clarify my career path.
  
### Education platforms
- Stepik (on Russian) ([https://stepik.org/])
  This platform offers numerous courses for DevOps and Data Scientists. What I appreciate about this source is that it includes genuinely challenging exercises. By solving them, you gain a deep 
  understanding of the material. However, this can also be a drawback, especially during busy work periods when you may not want to invest a significant amount of time in acquiring a new skill.

  The courses I have completed on this platform include:
